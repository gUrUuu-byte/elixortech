        question: "What kind of projects does Elixor Technologies handle?",
        answer: "We specialize in building MVPs, full-stack web apps, SaaS platforms, CRM systems, ERP portals, and company websites. From financial platforms like BookMyCA to enterprise-grade tools like ACTTS CRM — if it's digital, we build it."
    },
    {
        question: "How fast can you deliver a working product?",
        answer: "Speed is in our DNA. A typical MVP or landing page ships in under 4 weeks. More complex systems like ERP portals or CRM dashboards take 6–8 weeks. We cut through the noise to deliver the essential features that prove your market fit first."
    },
    {
        question: "What is your tech stack?",
        answer: "We work with modern, battle-tested technologies: React, Next.js, Node.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. For payments we integrate Razorpay. Every project is built on future-proof architecture designed to scale with your business."
    },
    {
        question: "How does the pricing work?",
        answer: "No scope creep or runaway hourly bills. We offer clear, milestone-based pricing that aligns with your startup's runway. You know exactly what you're paying for at every stage. Book a slot to get a custom quote tailored to your project."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you handle design as well, or just development?",
        answer: "We're end-to-end. That means UI/UX design, frontend development, backend engineering, database architecture, and deployment — all handled by us. You focus on your business strategy while we handle the heavy lifting of design and code."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I see examples of your past work?",
        answer: "Absolutely. Check out our Projects section above — we've built BookMyCA (a financial services platform with Razorpay integration), ACTTS CRM (a full customer relationship management system), an Enterprise Resource Planning Portal, and Hansha Pharmaceuticals' website, among others."
    },
    {
        question: "What happens after the project is delivered?",
        answer: "We don't disappear after launch. We offer post-launch support, bug fixes, and iterative improvements. Many of our clients continue working with us as their product evolves — from MVP to growth stage and beyond."
    },
    {
        question: "How do I get started?",
        answer: "Simple — hit the 'Book a Slot' button in the navbar or the 'Start your project' CTA in the hero section. Fill in your details and preferred time, and we'll set up a discovery call to understand your vision, scope, and timeline."
